FBP protocol examples
========================

Examples in various languages on how to implement:

* FBP or data-flow runtimes
* (_TODO_) User interfaces / programming tools for FBP runtimes
* (_TODO_) A FBP subgraph representation of a non-FBP system

Terminology
---------------
We here use the term "_FBP_" in a wider sense, less strict than the
[FBP specification](https://github.com/flowbased/flowbased.org/wiki).
The protocol does not mandate a specific execution style, and may thus
be used with other types of dataflow systems, as well as systems which are not dataflow.

It is up to the user to determine whether it makes sense to use the FBP protocol
with a system which is not strictly Flow-based-programming.
